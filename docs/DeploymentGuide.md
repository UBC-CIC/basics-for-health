# Requirements

Before you deploy, you must have the following accounts:

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

You must also have the following installed on your device:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

Once you have downloaded docker desktop, follow the installation instructions for the FHIR dev sandbox [here](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/smart-dev-sandbox).

# Clone The Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository onto your machine. To do this:

1. Create a folder on your computer to contain the project code.
2. For an Apple computer, open Terminal. If on a Windows machine, open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. Enter into the folder you made using the command `cd path/to/folder`. To find the path to a folder on a Mac, right click on the folder and press `Get Info`, then select the whole text found under `Where:` and copy with âŒ˜C. On Windows (not WSL), enter into the folder on File Explorer and click on the path box (located to the left of the search bar), then copy the whole text that shows up.
3. Clone the github repository by entering the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-CIC/basics-for-health.git
```

The code should now be in the folder you created. Navigate into the folder containing the Amplify project by running the command:

```bash
cd basics-for-health
```

# Deployment

Before deploying the Amplify project we need to create an IAM Role that will give us the permissions needed to implement this solution. Run the following line of code:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cfn-amplifyRole.yaml --stack-name amplifyconsole-basics4health-backend-role --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

If you have multiple AWS Profiles, use the one with sufficient admin permissions by appending the following text to the end of the command, replacing the profile name with the profile you would like to use for the solution.

```bash
--profile [PROFILE NAME]
```

This step creates an IAM role called **amplifyconsole-basics4health-backend-role** that will be used on the next step.

The **Deploy to Amplify Console** button will take you to your AWS console to deploy the solution. Make sure you are logged into your AWS account.

1. On the AWS console, select your region and click `Connect to GitHub`.

2. Authorize AWS Amplify with your GitHub account (if required).

3. Select the **amplifyconsole-basics4health-backend-role** we made previously for the deployment role, and then press `Save and Deploy`

4. The deployment will take a few minutes. Wait until the status of **Verify** is green

5. Next, on the left side menu, click on Rewrites and redirects and click the `Edit` button. Click and replace the first rule's **source address** (or add a rule if there is none) to `</^((?!\.(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|ttf)$).)*$/>`. Replace the **target address** to `/index.html`, and replace the **type** to `200 (Rewrite)`. Refer to [AWS's Page on Single Page Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html#redirects-for-single-page-web-apps-spa) for further information on why that was necessary.
    
    It should look like this once you are done:

The app is now deployed!
